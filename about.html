            <h1>Club History</h1>
            <p>In October 1967 the Diamond Valley Gem club was officially formed.
                That year there were ten gem clubs formed in Victoria and we
                were one of them. The club emerged from humble beginnings with
                workshops being held at a member’s home using limited equipment.</p>
            <p>Our first club President was Franz Zyllstra and years later the club
                became an incorporated body. On the eighth of February 1968 the
                clubroom was opened at the Sullivan’s home in Montmorency. The
                first newsletter was issued in May 1968. In late 1968 the club held
                its first gem show, which in fact was the first national gem show to
                be held anywhere in Australia.</p>    
            <p>In later years the club has progressed to having our own clubhouse.
                On the thirteenth of July 1975 about seventy members went along
                to an open day at the new clubrooms, which were located at the
                western end of Stanley Street behind Stortford Avenue in Ivanhoe.</p>    
            <p>In following years we approached the council again for larger
                premises. Councillor Critcheley took the case to the council and a
                new premises was found at 135 Henry Street, Greensborough.</p>   
            <p>In 2019 the club again approached council for larger premises
                and in 2020 we were offered the old girl guide hall at 20 Noorong
                Avenue, Bundoora which is now our present location</p>     
            <p>After Fifty years we have a healthy membership, good
                accommodation for our equipment, and we offer a good range
                of activities for our members to ensure that the club is around for
                another fifty years.</p>
